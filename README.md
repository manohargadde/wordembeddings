# Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are a method of representing words as dense vectors of numbers. This representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation in a high-dimensional space. These representations capture the semantic relationships between words.

Word embeddings are pivotal in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks because they provide a dense, continuous vector representation of words, capturing their meanings, relationships, and contexts in a much more efficient way than earlier methods.

We will delve into different types of Word Embeddings and their corresponding code in the Python Notebook file
