# FastText Overview

FastText, developed by Facebook AI Research, is an extension of the Word2Vec model. It enhances Word2Vec's handling of out-of-vocabulary words and performs well with morphologically rich languages by representing words as bags of character n-grams.

## How FastText Works

### 1. Subword Information
- **Representation**: FastText treats words as a sum of their character n-grams. For example, the word "playing" would be broken down into "pla", "lay", "ayi", and "ing".
- **Application**: This method helps FastText understand and create embeddings for words based on their subword structures, facilitating better handling of morphologically similar words.

### 2. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words
- **Method**: FastText can infer vectors for words not seen during training by using known subwords. This capability is crucial for handling new words seamlessly.

## Advantages of FastText

- **Morphological Richness**: Particularly effective in languages where words are formed by combining morphemes, such as German or Turkish.
- **Out-of-Vocabulary Words**: Unlike Word2Vec, FastText can generate embeddings for unseen words, improving its robustness and utility in dynamic linguistic environments.
- **Character Information**: By analyzing subwords, FastText handles misspellings or variations in word forms better than models that only analyze whole words.

## Use Cases for FastText

- **Languages with Complex Morphology**: It performs well in languages with complex word formations.
- **Handling New or Rare Words**: Its ability to decompose words into subwords allows it to handle new vocabulary that may not have been present in the training corpus.

## Limitations of FastText

- **Contextual Understanding**: Like Word2Vec, FastText does not account for the context beyond the local word level. Modern models like BERT provide better context understanding by analyzing sentences more holistically.
- **Resource Requirements**: Storing and processing subword information makes FastText more resource-intensive than simpler models like Word2Vec.

## FastText vs. Word2Vec

| Feature               | Word2Vec                       | FastText                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Word Representation   | Treats words as atomic units   | Breaks words into character-level n-grams |
| Out-of-Vocabulary     | Cannot handle unseen words     | Handles unseen words via subword n-grams |
| Typo Sensitivity      | Sensitive to misspellings      | Robust to typos and variations            |
| Morphological Handling| Limited                        | Effective in rich morphological settings  |
| Computational Cost    | Lower                          | Higher due to n-gram analysis             |

## Conclusion

FastText offers significant improvements over Word2Vec by handling morphologically complex languages and new words more effectively. However, for tasks requiring deep contextual understanding, models like BERT are recommended due to their advanced capabilities in sentence-level analysis.
